    <h1>Cybersploit1</h1>
    <p>Running a nmap scan gets us:</p>
    <img src="img/1.png" alt="1">
    <p>With the given scan, we can first explore port 80, which gives a website.</p>
    <img src="img/2.png" alt="2">
    <p>Dirbing the website gives us some options to poke at.</p>
    <img src="img/3.png" alt="3">
    <p>Going into robots.txt displays a base64 encrypted hash. Decrypted using cyberchef revels a YouTube channel.</p>
    <img src="img/4.png" alt="4">
    <p>Looking at the page source on the website shows an HTML comment giving the username of the user in plaintext.</p>
    <img src="img/5.png" alt="5">
    <p>We know ssh is open so we can remote into their server.</p>
    <img src="img/6.png" alt="6">
    <p>The first flag is located in the home directory.</p>


    <br>

    <h2>Getting Root</h2>
    <p>Doing a quick sudo -l check show us having now sudo privileges for this user.<br>
    We can then check for the kernal version this server is running with uname -a.</p>
    <img src="img/7.png" alt="7">
    <p>A quick google search leads to an expolit on
        <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292">Exploit-DB</a>
    </p>
    <p>Downloading the script, and we can get this script into the target server in different ways.
        The fast for this current on scp since ssh is open.</p>
    <img src="img/8.png" alt="8">
    <p>Instruction on using the downloaded script is in the script, which leads us to root access.</p>
    <img src="img/9.png" alt="9">
    <p>A quick cd into the root fold and the root flag is found.</p>

    <h2>Alt Way</h2>
    <p>Instead of using the exploit-db script, using Pwnkit can also work since it shows pkexec in suid, and the version
        of Linux is old enough. <br>Getting Pwnkit on the server the same way using scp.</p>
