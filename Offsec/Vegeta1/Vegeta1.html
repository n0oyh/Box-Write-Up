    <h2>About This Lab</h2>
    <p>Utilize enumeration and web enumeration techniques to identify vulnerabilities. Engage in understanding Morse
      code and implement privilege escalation strategies to enhance your access. This lab is designed to capitalize on
      your skills in vulnerability exploitation.</p>
    <h2>Recon</h2>
    <p>Running a nmap scan on the giving IP gives us:</p>
    <img src="img/1.png" alt="1">
    <p>We can see ssh open but don't have any creds yet so that can wait for now, so it on to port 80, an http website.</p>
    <h2>Port 80</h2>
    <p>Visiting the website we get a simple one-liner with an image of Vegeta.</p>
    <img src="img/2.png" alt="2">
    <p>With nothing going on and standing out let do some simple checks then. A source code check if they have hidden
      anything in the HTML.. Nothing. What about robots.txt? OOo, we are given a directory to explore.</p>
    <img src="img/3.png" alt="3">
    <p>Let's explore what /find_me has to offer.</p>
    <img src="img/4.png" alt="4">
    <p>We can see an HTML file in this directory, which leads to nothing really visible on the surface level.
      Let's check the source code again. OOOO, scrolling down we can some a super long comment, which seems to be
      encrypted. Let's decrypt it.</p>
    <img src="img/5.png" alt="5">
    <p>Whipping out the cyberchef using base64 decode, we get more random jumbo, but it looks like simialr to what we
      found. Let do another base64 decode. We got a PNG header, OOOO. Lets downlad it off cyberchef and see our
      image.</p>
    <img src="img/6.png" alt="6">
    <p>We were givein a QR code, interesting. We can scan this code in two ways, with your phone like a normal person
      or with zbarimg.</p>
    <img src="img/7.png" alt="7">
    <p>Either way you do it you get Password : topshellv. <br>
      Let's run a gobuster scan to see if we can use it, while it scan lets paste in google if anything comes up.
      Mine top result came back with a GitHub page with the. </p>
    <img src="img/8.png" alt="8">
    <p>So I am assuming it's not something we can use. Let's check if our gobuster scan has anything.</p>
    <img src="img/9.png" alt="9">
    <p>Let's check out /admin</p>
    <img src="img/10.png" alt="10">
    <p>Admin.php doesnt really help us since we cant modify it anyway. HMMMMM. <br>
      Lets directory scan this box again but since the name of this box was Vegeta, try some Dragon Ball character
      names instead.</p>
    <img src="img/11.png" alt="11">
    <p>Let's check out /bulma</p>
    <img src="img/12.png" alt="12">
    <p>Downloading the .wav file plays some beeps and boops in a pattern. MORSE CODE. <br>
      Now being in the 21 first century, few people know morse code off the top of their heads, so it's gonna be a
      little painful discerning the beeps and boops. So smack that file in them chatgpt and pray then get it. <br>
      Mine was able to spit out the morse code pretty clean: <br>
      ..- ... . .-. / ---... / - .-. ..- -. -.- ... / .--. .- ... ... .-- --- .-. -.. / ---... / ..- ... ...-- .-. -.--.
      ... / .. -. / -.. --- .-.. .-.. .- .-. ... / ... -.-- -- -... --- .-.. -.--.- <br>
      Let's get this translated to english <br>
      USER : TRUNKS PASSWORD : --------------------- <br>
      We now have access to a set of username and password, time to ssh.</p>
    <h2>SSH</h2>
    <p>With the creds we are in!!!</p>
    <img src="img/13.png" alt="13">
    <p>First flag is ours.</p>
    <img src="img/14.png" alt="14">
    <h2>Getting Root</h2>
    <p>As always, since we have a password lets check if sudo can be used. AND NOPE. <br>
      Ok, lets see what we are working with, a ls -al in the home directory.</p>
    <img src="img/15.png" alt="15">
    <p>Let's check the bash_history file if they left any clues.</p>
    <img src="img/16.png" alt="16">
    <p>OOO clues left indeed. We can the user was trying to make a sudo like user with all its creds for us to know.
      Let's see if we have any perms for /etc/passwd.</p>
    <img src="img/17.png" alt="17">
    <p>We very much do, lets try the previous commands. <br>
      perl -le 'print crypt("Password@973","addedsalt")'</p>
    <img src="img/18.png" alt="18">
    <p>echo "Tom:ad7t5uIalqMws:0:0:User_like_root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd <br>
    not into Tom</p>
    <img src="img/19.png" alt="19">
    <p>BOOM, root access granted. Time for our flag.</p>
    <img src="img/20.png" alt="20">
    <p>I wonder, which one it is?</p>
    <p></p>
